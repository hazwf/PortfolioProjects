This project includes a Python script for web scraping that pulls together country codes, states, and the countries they’re linked to. The data is cleaned and standardized for consistency. By doing this, the airline routes are mapped by country, which really helps when visualizing data and comparing insights across countries. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Python on Jupyter notebook, EDA is performed on the collected reviews dataset to:
