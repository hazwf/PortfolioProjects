**Hi, I’m Haz!**

I have a strong passion for technology and data, particularly in analyzing large datasets and uncovering valuable insights. This repository showcases a selection of my projects that highlight my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Below you’ll find a summary of each project, including key features and the technologies used.

## 1) Airlines Review Analysis using Python and Tableau

**Description:**<br/>
This project analyzes customer reviews across different airlines to examine satisfaction levels, identify trends, and uncover factors influencing high or low ratings. 

**Goal:** <br/>
To assess customer satisfaction, identify trends, and uncover factors that influence high or low ratings.

**Outcome:** <br/>
Uncovered actionable insights about passenger preferences, which could help airlines improve their service offerings.
	
**Key Features**
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Web Scraping
* Dashboard Creation

## 2) Hotel Revenue Analysis using PostgreSQL and Power BI

[Link to project](https://github.com/hazwf/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Hotel%20Revenue%20Analysis)
   
**Description:** <br/>
This project analyzes 2018-2020 hotel booking data, focusing on cancellation patterns, revenue by hotel type, popular meal choices, and booking distribution by country and market segment. It also examines room rate trends, guest repetition, and the impact of special requests on spending to uncover key booking and spending patterns.

**Goal:** <br/>
To analyze hotel booking data from 2018-2020 to uncover key trends and patterns related to cancellations, revenue by hotel type, and booking distribution. The project aimed to optimize pricing strategies and improve operational efficiency by identifying patterns in cancellations and guest behavior.

**Outcome:**
* Uncovered patterns in booking cancellations, revenue generation, and guest preferences, providing actionable insights for pricing optimization.<br/>
* Identified significant trends in booking behavior across market segments, helping hotels target the most profitable customer groups.<br/>
* Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key trends, making it easier to analyze booking patterns and adjust strategies for pricing and resource allocation. This enabled a deeper understanding of hotel booking dynamics and better forecasting of trends.

**Key Features**
* SQL based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Dashboard Creation
  
## 3) Machine Learning Models for Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations and Demand

[Link to project](https://github.com/hazwf/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Predicting%20Hotel%20Booking%20Cancellations%20and%20Demand)

**Description:<br/>**
This project develops two machine learning models: one for predicting booking cancellations based on existing features in the dataset and another for forecasting booking demand for near-future dates using the XGBRegressor model and incorporating lag features.

**Goal:**
To build predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast hotel booking cancellations and demand for near-future dates, allowing hotels to proactively manage resources, adjust pricing, and minimize revenue loss due to cancellations.

**Outcome:**
* Developed two models to predict hotel booking cancellations and demand, achieving 88% accuracy with
Random Forest and visualizing consistent results with XGBoost.
* The implementation of these models helped hotels better predict high-demand periods, optimize booking strategies, and reduce overbooking scenarios.

**Key Features**
* Data Engineering and Prepocessing
* Machine Learning Model Development
