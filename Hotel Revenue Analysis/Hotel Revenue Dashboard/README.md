This dashboard presents hotel booking data from July 2018 to August 2020, focusing on revenue. It shows a total revenue of $22.95 million from 89,000 arrivals, factoring in the discounts provided to guests based on their market segment. According to the pie chart, cancellations and no-shows account for about 37% of the bookings.

The line chart indicates that bookings are typically lowest at the start of the year, likely due to the post-holiday slowdown. Interestingly, 2020 saw higher bookings than 2019 at the beginning of the year, which could be attributed to people opting for domestic travel due to COVID-19. Bookings peaked around August and September, with 2019 significantly outperforming both 2018 and 2020. The reasons for this trend are not clear and could be further explored, especially in relation to any popular events happening near the hotel(s)

The Online Travel Agent (OTA) segment stands out as the most popular, contributing the highest number of bookings across all years, followed by the Offline Travel Agent/Tour Operator (TA/TO) and Direct Booking segments. In contrast, the aviation segment has the least bookings, with no records for the complementary segment.

In terms of revenue by country, Portugal leads with 5.6 million bookings, followed by the UK at 3.4 million.

Regarding room types, Room A generates the most revenue and arrivals, contributing $10.7 million from 50,000 arrivals, followed by Room D with $6 million.
